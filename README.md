# chall_19
repo for challenge 19


For this challenge I was asked to build a streamlit front end that accompanies a backend cryptographic hiring service. 

The first step is importing my mnemonic from ganashe & chaning the file name so it is hidden. Then, I import a few functions from the the crypto_wallet.py to fintech_finder.py as to be able to actually use the functions in the app. Then, I calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas, to pay the worker for their time. Next, I sign the transaction that will actually pay the worker. 

Here is the front end:<img width="1098" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-21 at 6 05 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98225311/185813122-166bcfae-fc90-4549-9257-4f7348c610a1.png">

Here is a transaction I sent using the frontend within my ganashe: <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-21 at 6 06 35 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98225311/185813127-252b7ad1-62b1-498c-912a-c8bf839d8e9a.png">

Here is the previously mentioned transactions information within my ganashe: <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-21 at 6 07 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98225311/185813168-abbabe20-8255-4f9f-992b-49f82f72fb32.png">
